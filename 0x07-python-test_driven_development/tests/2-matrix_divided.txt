The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
===============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
------------------------

Importing function from the module:
    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Dividing a matrix by 3
    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 3)
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Dividing matrix by 0:

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Dividing matrix by negative
    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], -1)
    [[-1.0, -2.0, -3.0], [-4.0, -5.0, -6.0]]

Dividing a matrix which has positive and negative integer/float numbers

    >>> matrix_divided([[-1, 3.1, 0], [78, -103.7, 54]], 9.2)
    [[-0.11, 0.34, 0.0], [8.48, -11.27, 5.87]]

Dividing matrix by float
    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], 1.1)
    [[0.91, 1.82, 2.73], [3.64, 4.55, 5.45]]

Passing an empty matrix:

    >>> matrix_divided([], 10)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Passing a tuple as an argument:

    >>> matrix_divided((3, 6, 9), 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Dividing a matrix which its rows don't have the same size:

    >>> matrix_divided([[22, 34], [2.78, 7.1, -10, 2], [-8]], 3)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Dividing a matrix which some of its elements aren't integer/float numbers:

    >>> matrix_divided([[2.7, 4], ['6', 8.4], [10.1, '12'], [5.3, '10.2', 15.8]], 5)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Passing a matrix which one of its elements is a tuple:

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, -1], (2, -2), [3, -3]], 1)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Passing div as a list

    >>> matrix_divided([[5.7, 8.1], [7.7, 4.9]], [2])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: div must be a number

Passing div as a string

    >>> matrix_divided([[10, 50], [30, 20]], "10")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    	...
    TypeError: div must be a number
